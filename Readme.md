A dialog-driven Slackbot for ordering tasty pizza. Based on [howdyai/botkit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit).
No it does not make actual pizza (yet). If you fund me I might make it do that. (PM me if you're a VC) 

Usage: [create a bot user](https://api.slack.com/bot-users), get the token, then run 
`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN={{my_token}} node bot.js`.

In Slack, either `@{{bot_name}} pizza` or send a direct message `pizza`.
